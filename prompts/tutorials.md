✅ LLM Prompt: Beginner-Level, Engaging SDK Tutorial Generator

Role: You are an expert educator, technical writer, and senior blockchain engineer.
Task: Produce a beginner-friendly, exciting, and structured tutorial (or set of tutorials) guiding a junior JavaScript frontend developer on how to leverage the [insert SDK name] to build real Web3 experiences.

Audience:

Junior front-end developers

Comfortable with JavaScript and browser-based coding

Limited understanding of system/security concepts

Has used MetaMask or similar wallets

Has made simple transactions against RPC endpoints

Has NOT built complex smart contract integrations before

✅ Output Requirements
1. Design a captivating, motivating tutorial (or tutorial series)

Must be fun, accessible, and inspiring

Must provide concrete tasks, code samples, and checkpoints

Present a real mini-project (e.g., NFT minter, transaction visualizer, wallet dashboard, secure signing playground, on-chain voting demo)

2. Structure the tutorial around well-formed subtopics

Each subtopic must include:

A clear learning objective

Simple explanation

Step-by-step instructions

Sample code (JS/TS preferred)

Links to documentation (official docs, standards, RFCs, relevant tools)

"Go deeper" expansion options
(e.g., to security concepts, network architecture, EVM internals)

Critical-thinking prompts, such as:

“What assumptions does this system make?”

“What are its security constraints?”

“Where can failure occur?”

“What trust assumptions are built into this flow?”

“How would you monitor or debug this step?”

3. Cover the following concepts in a scaffolded way
A. Fundamentals (Beginner level)

What this SDK is and what problems it solves

How it fits into typical dApp architecture

Concepts the student must know (RPCs, wallets, accounts, networks)

Setting up the environment (Node, bundler, browser tooling)

How to connect a wallet

How to send a basic transaction

How to read on-chain data

B. Practical application (Hands-on coding)

Provide at least one end-to-end mini-project such as:

“Build a Transaction Dashboard With Realtime Updates”

“Create a Secure Signing Playground to Understand Risks”

“Deploy and Interact With a Testnet NFT Contract Using the SDK”

“Build a simple DEX price viewer with client-side signing”

The project must be:

Beginner-appropriate

Fun and motivating

Deployable using popular tools (Vite, Next.js, simple JS script)

C. Security intuition (lightweight)

Explain in non-scary language:

What can go wrong when interacting with wallets

Why signing and transaction formats matter

What replay attacks and phishing look like

The concept of trusted vs untrusted inputs

Why RPCs are not “magic backends”

D. System-level constraints

Ask the learner to reflect on:

Network latency

Gas fees and block times

Chain finality

What happens when RPCs fail

When and why transactions get dropped

SDK limitations or assumptions

4. Provide optional next steps at the end

Suggest paths like:

Building deeper wallet integrations

Learning smart contract basics

Extending the mini-project

Recommended reading

Exercises to reinforce intuition

"Try breaking your own code" prompts to deepen understanding

5. Tone & Presentation Style

Encouraging, beginner-friendly

No jargon unless defined

Use diagrams, analogies, and simple explanations

Keep code runnable and minimal

Provide checkpoints like “🎉 You did it!”

⭐ Your Goal

Create a single tutorial OR a complete multi-part series that:

Makes learners excited

Helps them mentally model how the SDK works

Gives them real usable code

Provides documentation links throughout

Teaches them to think critically (not just copy/paste)

If you'd like, I can now:

✔ Fill in the SDK name and generate a ready-to-publish tutorial series
✔ Customize it for your actual product (Wallet API, Indexer API, ZK proofs, etc.)
✔ Tailor it for MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ethers.js, Viem, or web3.js
✔ Add exercises, diagrams, or a certification flow

Just tell me the SDK name you say! https://github.com/tetherto/wdk-wallet-solana
