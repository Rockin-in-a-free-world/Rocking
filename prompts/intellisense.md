✅ Specifically what you want for Sublime Text — totally doable.

 build a Node module to provide IDE features for Sublime Text 4+

If your node already has functionality like:

indexing files

resolving references

mapping documentation fields

normalizing paths

generating internal IDs

or any schema-driven behavior

…then you can expose this through an LSP server and editors can use it to provide:

🔹 IntelliSense

Field suggestions, completions, auto-fill.

🔹 Hover tooltips

Show metadata, definitions, descriptions.

🔹 Diagnostics

Warnings about missing links, bad references, outdated fields.

🔹 Code actions

"Fix links"
"Update all references"
"Insert required schema fields"

🔹 Automated link updating
